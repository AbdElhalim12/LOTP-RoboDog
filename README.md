# LOTP RoboDog Prototype-1
This is my first quadropod robotic project which has still lots of things to do. I would like to share STL files, descriptions, components, instructions. But please be aware that this is just a test project which helps me to learn fundementals of this science, and which prepares myself for second prototype.
